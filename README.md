Days2Bin
An indicator to show number of days until different kerbside
bins/trash/recycling etc are due to be collected.

Hardware - Raspberry Pi Pico W, DS3231 RTC and
Core Electronics GlowBit (based on WS2812 addressable LEDs).
 
The device is powered on by a pair of logic level MOSFETs
triggered by grounding via a momentary pushbutton, and kept alive
by one of the Pico W GPIO's.
